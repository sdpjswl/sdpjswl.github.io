The less said the better. I got into iOS development in late 2012 by sheer chance. Now I'm making a career out of it. Somewhat.

I have a working knowledge of:

<ul class="skill-list">
	<li>Objective-C, obviously</li>
	<li>Swift</li>
</ul>

I can figure out:

<ul class="skill-list">
	<li>Third party SDKs</li>
	<li>REST APIs</li>
	<li>App Store uploads</li>
</ul>

I am interested in:

<ul class="skill-list">
	<li>Ruby</li>
	<li>Cocoa</li>
	<li>Android</li>
	<li>Web designing</li>
	<li>Web development</li>
</ul>

I have accidentally open sourced some libraries. I am most satisfied with:

<ul class="skill-list">
	<li>ASJOverflowButton</li>
	<li>ASJDropDownMenu</li>
	<li>ASJColoredScrollIndicators</li>
	<li>ASJPushNotificationManager</li>
	<li>ASJCoreDataOperation</li>
</ul>

I publish my libraries on [Github](https://github.com/sudeepjaiswal){:target="_blank"} and [CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org/owners/9860){:target="_blank"}. My [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/sudeepjaiswal){:target="_blank"} has some demos that may or may not be of any use. If you're interested, take a look at some [projects](/projects) I've been involved with.

I take my work seriously and try writing code that won't be made fun of. I've written spaghetti code in the past that makes me laugh now. I enjoy learning; and sharing what I have learnt. I like being asked questions and to fix bugs, and discussing technical work things.
