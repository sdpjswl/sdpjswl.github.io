Everything feels like a distraction  
A delay to something inevitable  
I am empty inside  
Happiness is fleeting, an idea  
People I like are around me  
But I feel like I am alone  
There are too few hours in the day  
Night comes and I am wide awake  
Fatigued, but wink does not come  
Unable to concentrate  
It feels like I am being  
Pulled in five directions at once  
Always in the hunt for the next distraction  
Like an addict, I realise  
But it's hard to let go  
The sun comes up every morning  
The clouds in my mind block the light
